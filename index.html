			Samantha’s work and school background help contribute to her creativity and strong work ethic, which in turn makes her a perfect candidate for a web development and design career.
			<br>
			<br>
			Samantha has recently attained her Associate’s degree in Web Development and Design. With the many diverse and difficult classes she has taken during her educational pursuit, she is ready to enter the work force.
			<br>
			<br>
			While attending college full time, Samantha worked part time as a Resident Care Assistant at Fairmount Homes Retirement Community to help pay for her schooling. She has trained many new employees, and has also taken on many extra responsibilities when staffing was short. She goes above and beyond to help her coworkers and the residents in her care. As a result, she can easily lead a team of workers and is able to help those around her with her knowledge and compassion.
			<br>
			<br>
			While she loves caring for her residents, a career in Web Development and Design is her ultimate goal.
